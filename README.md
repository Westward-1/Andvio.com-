## Website Structure

The website consists of the following files:
- `index.html` - The main HTML structure of the website
- `styles.css` - All styling for the website
- `script.js` - JavaScript functionality including form handling and payment processing

## Button Labeling

All buttons have been properly labeled with unique IDs for easy identification and modification:

- Navigation menu: `nav-overview`, `nav-target`, `nav-solution`, `nav-offer`, `nav-launch`
- Main CTA button: `get-started-btn`
- Hero section buttons: `view-offer-btn`, `explore-solution-btn`
- Package buttons: `foundation-package-btn`, `breakthrough-package-btn`
- Form submission button: `submit-form-btn`
- Footer links: `privacy-policy-link`, `terms-of-service-link`

To modify any button text, simply locate the button by its ID in the HTML file and change the text between the opening and closing tags.

## Payment Integration

The website is prepared for payment integration. In the `script.js` file, you'll find a commented section that provides a template for integrating with a payment processor.

To implement payment processing:
1. Choose a payment processor (Stripe, PayPal, etc.)
2. Uncomment and modify the payment processing code in `script.js`
3. Replace the placeholder code with your actual payment gateway integration
4. Test the payment flow thoroughly before going live
